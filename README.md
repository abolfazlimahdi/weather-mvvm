This is a MVVM project sample. It uses navigation, data-binding, Dagger2, Retrofit, Glide and Coroutines.

Notes:
* It does not contain repository yet because it does not save data in database! Database and repository will be added soon.
* It does not contain tests, but tests will be added soon.
* SearchFragment uses a json file which is very large. I'll be looking for alternatives.
